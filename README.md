# DankTimesBot-Plugin-DeepFry

Plugin you can use to deep-fry images. Reply to a photo with `/deepfry <fry-scale>`. The `fry-scale` determines how many times
the frying algorithm is ran on your photo. Max is 100, but anything over 30 or so probably fries your image into oblivion.

## Changelog

### 1.0.2

- You can now deepfry mp4s and gifs

### 1.0.1

- You can now deepfry non-animated images
